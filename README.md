## Project Summary
This repository features a Python-based analysis of house sales in King County, Washington.

When determining the value of a property, two key factors often stand out: the size of the house and the land it occupies. If you've ever browsed real estate listings, you might have an idea of how pricing works. Overpricing a home can significantly reduce the chances of a successful sale, while underpricing could mean missing out on potential profits.

To ensure a property is accurately priced, a thorough analysis should always be conducted before buying or selling. This project explores the housing market in King County, identifying the factors that influence home prices. Using machine learning models, it predicts accurate market values based on these factors, providing insights to support fair and informed pricing decisions.
